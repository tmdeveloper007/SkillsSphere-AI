## ⚡ Quick Start (Unified Setup)

To simplify setup, you can now run the entire project using root-level scripts.

### Install all dependencies

```bash
### Install all dependencies

If the unified installer script encounters execution restriction errors on your system terminal, run the installation manually using directory prefixes:

```bash
npm install
npm install --prefix Backend
npm install --prefix Frontend
```

This installs:

- Root dependencies
- Client dependencies
- Server dependencies
- Python microservice dependencies (creates `interview-ai-service/venv` and downloads spaCy model)

### Run everything (client + server + Python microservice) from root

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start:

- Frontend (client)
- Backend (server)
- Interview AI Service (Python microservice on port 8000)

### One command (first-time or fresh clone)

```bash
npm run quickstart
```

### Optional: run only client + server (no Python service)

```bash
npm run dev:web
```

> ⚠️ Backend requires environment variables to run properly. Refer to the Environment Setup section below.

## 🐳 Run with Docker (Recommended)

To avoid manual installation of Python dependencies, Node modules, and OS-level packages (like FFmpeg), you can run the entire stack using Docker.

### Prerequisites
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory.
2. Ensure you have created your local `.env` file from `.env.example`. Keep real secrets out of git.
3. Run the following command from the root directory:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

Access the applications:
- **Client**: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
- **Server**: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
- **AI Microservice**: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

To stop the containers, press `Ctrl+C` or run `docker-compose down`.

## Scalable Folder Structure

The following structure keeps the project modular and easy to scale for new contributors:

## For Open-Source Contributors

If you want to contribute, start by understanding:

1. Which user group your change helps (student, tutor, recruiter)
2. Which module it belongs to (classrooms, resumes, matching, interviews, dashboard)
3. Whether the change impacts frontend, backend, AI/ML, or multiple layers

This approach keeps contributions focused, reviewable, and scalable.

- Contribution Guide: `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Code of Conduct: `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
- Security Policy: `SECURITY.md`
- PR Template: `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
- Issue Templates: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`

## PR Checks and Code Review Safety

Automated checks run on pull requests to `main` through:

- `.github/workflows/pr-quality-checks.yml`

These checks validate docs/workflows and, once app code is added, automatically run lint/test/build for `client`, `server`, and `ai-ml` when their dependency manifests exist.

## 🚀 Running the Project (Manual Setup)

### Client

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Server

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Interview AI Service (Python microservice)

This service powers speech-to-text transcription and answer evaluation for the Mock Interview module. The Node backend can run without it (it falls back to mock scores), but for real AI evaluation you should start it locally.

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+

```bash
cd interview-ai-service

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate
# Linux/Mac:
# source venv/bin/activate
# Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download spaCy English model
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

# Run the API (default port 8000)
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Health check: `http://localhost:8000/health`

Optional env var (defaults to `base`): `WHISPER_MODEL_SIZE=tiny|base|small|medium|large-v3`

## 🔐 Environment Variables Setup

> ⚠️ The backend will not start without configuring the required environment variables.

### Server

1. Copy the root example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Update required values in `.env`:

- `MONGO_URI`
- `JWT_SECRET`
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` (Required for AI Cover Letter Generation)
- `REDIS_URL` (Required for caching API responses, e.g., redis://localhost:6379)

For secure setup, pre-commit protection, and credential rotation steps, see `docs/SECURITY_ENVIRONMENT.md`.

```env
# AI/ML Configuration (Required for semantic matching — free tier)
HF_API_TOKEN=your_hugging_face_token

# Redis Configuration
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Email Setup (if using console/smtp directly in server)
EMAIL_SERVICE_MODE=console
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
EMAIL_FROM="SkillsSphere AI" <your-email@gmail.com>

# Evaluator toggles and weights (optional)
EVALUATOR_SKILL_MATCH_ENABLED=true
EVALUATOR_KEYWORD_MATCH_ENABLED=true
EVALUATOR_EXPERIENCE_MATCH_ENABLED=true
EVALUATOR_SKILL_MATCH_WEIGHT=1
EVALUATOR_KEYWORD_MATCH_WEIGHT=0.2
EVALUATOR_EXPERIENCE_MATCH_WEIGHT=0.2

# Interview AI Service (Python microservice for answer evaluation)
INTERVIEW_AI_URL=http://localhost:8000
INTERVIEW_AI_TIMEOUT=10000
INTERVIEW_AI_TRANSCRIBE_TIMEOUT=30000
```

### Client

1. Copy the root example file if you have not already:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. For local development, keep:

- `MONGO_URI` or `MONGODB_URI`
- `PORT` (backend default: `5000`)
- `JWT_SECRET` (required for JWT registration)
- `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` (optional, default is `7d`)
- `HF_API_TOKEN` (free — required for semantic resume-to-job-description matching, get at <https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens>)
- `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000`

## 🔐 Google OAuth Setup

Setting up Google OAuth is required to enable the "Sign in with Google" feature. We have provided a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for configuring this in the Google Cloud Console.

📖 **Please read the complete guide here:** [docs/GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md](./docs/GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md)

### Quick Summary

1. Create a project in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Configure the **OAuth Consent Screen** (External, add Email & Profile scopes).
3. Create **OAuth 2.0 Client ID** (Web application).
   - Authorized JavaScript origin: `http://localhost:5173`
   - Authorized redirect URI: `http://localhost:5000/api/auth/google/callback`
4. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret into your `.env` file:

```env
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:5000/api/auth/google/callback
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

5. Restart the server (`npm run dev`).

**OAuth Flow Summary:**
- Frontend starts OAuth from `/api/auth/google`.
- Google redirects to backend callback (`GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL`).
- Backend creates JWT and redirects to frontend callback (`FRONTEND_URL/auth/callback`).

## 📧 Email SMTP Setup (Gmail)

To use real email notifications (OTP verification, password reset) via Gmail, follow these steps:

1. **Enable 2-Step Verification**: Go to your [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) and ensure 2-Step Verification is ON.
2. **Generate App Password**:
   - Search for "App Passwords" in your Google Account search bar.
   - Enter a name (e.g., "SkillsSphere AI").
   - Click **Create**.
   - Copy the **16-character code** (e.g., `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`).
3. **Update `.env`**:

   ```env
   EMAIL_SERVICE_MODE=smtp
   EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   EMAIL_PORT=587
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=abcd efgh ijkl mnop
   EMAIL_FROM="SkillsSphere AI" <your-email@gmail.com>
   ```

4. **Restart the server** to apply changes.

### 📝 Testing Email Verification (Console Mode)

For local development and testing without configuring an SMTP provider:
1. Set `EMAIL_SERVICE_MODE=console` in `.env`.
2. When registering a user, the server will output the 6-digit OTP directly to your terminal console instead of sending an email.
3. Retrieve this OTP from the server command line logs and enter it in the frontend verification modal to complete the registration flow.
